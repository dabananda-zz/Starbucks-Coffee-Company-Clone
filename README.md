# Starbucks-Coffee-Company-Clone
This is my first project related to restaurant/food. Although the Starbucks website looks very simple, I realized that it is a little bit complex website. It was a little difficult to set up the header of the website, especially in 4K resolution. And with a maximum width of 768 pixels, the website's menu work was very complicated. This is the first webpage I created where I used SASS. So maybe SASS and CSS codes can seem a little bit complicated and messy.  Creating this webpage was a very exciting journey for me. I have learned a lot while making it.
